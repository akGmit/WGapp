Week notes:
    Decided to use JavaScript for server implementation. Will be using Node.js server environment. Using Express framework for Node.js and Socket.io API for server functionality.
    Using Node as server side environment should provide possibility of app versions on different platforms(Mobile).
    Current idea of design:
        Server using Socket.IO API responds to various events sent by client app.
        Client app sends events to server and gets response.
        Try to implement Observer OO Design pattern in client app.
